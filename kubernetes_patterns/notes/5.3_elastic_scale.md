* The Elastic Scale pattern covers application scaling in multiple dimensions: 
    1. Horizontal scaling by adapting the number of Pod replicas.
    2. Vertical scaling by adapting resource requirements of Pods.
    3. Scaling the cluster itself by changing the number of cluster nodes.

**Problem**

**Solution**
* Creating an application configuration for autoscaling on a shared cloud platform without affecting other resources and the cluster itself requires significant trial and effort.
