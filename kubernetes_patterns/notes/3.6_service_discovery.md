* The service discovery pattern provides a stable endpoint at which clients of a service can access the instances providing the service.
* For this purpose, Kubernetes provides multiple solutions depending on whether the service consumers and producers are located on or off the cluster.

**Problem**
* Interaction between an application and other service can be initiated internally or via external stimulus.
* Examples of internally initiated interactions:
    * An application within a Pod that reaches a file server and starts consuming files.
    * Or an application connecting to a message broker/relational database/key-value store and starts reading or writing data.
* For internally initiated interactions, we don't need any additional Kubernetes setup.

* The more common-usecase of Kubernetes workloads occurs when we have long running services expecting external stimulus, most commonly in the form of incoming HTTP connections from other Pods within the cluster or external systems.

* In these cases, *service consumers need a mechanism for discovering Pods that are dynamically placed by the scheduler and sometimes dynamically scaled up and down*.

* It would be a significant challenge if we had to perform *tracking, registering and discovering endpoints of dynamic Kubernetes pods ourselves*. Service discovery pattern solves this problem.

**Solution**
* **Pre Kubernetes Era: Client-side Service Discovery**
    * Most common method of service-discovery was through client-side discovery.
    * When a consumer service had to call another service that might be scaled to multiple instances, the service consumer would have a discovery agent capable of looking at a registry and then choosing one to call.
    * Classically that would be done either via an embedded agent within the consumer(eg. Zookeeper, Consul, Robbin) or a colocated process like Prana.

* **Post Kubernetes Era: Server-side Service Discovery**
    * Many of the non-functional responsibilities of distributed systems such as *placement, health check, healing and resource isolation* are moving into the platform and so is service discovery.
    * In the Kubernetes, all of it happens behind the scenes so that a service consumer calls a fixed virtual Service endpoint that can dynamically discover Service instances implemented as Pods.

* Multiple mechanisms can be used to implement service discovery pattern depending on whether the service consumer is within or outside the cluster and whether the service provider is within or outside the cluster.
