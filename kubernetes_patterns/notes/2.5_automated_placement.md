* Automated placement is the core function of the Kubernetes scheduler for assigning new Pods to nodes satisfying container resource requests and honoring *scheduling policies*.
* This patterns describes:
    * The principles of Kubernetes' scheduling algorithm.
    * The way to influence the placement decision from the outside.

**Problem**
* Containers have dependencies among themselves, dependencies to nodes, and resource demands, all of that changes over time too.
* The resources available on a cluster also vary over time, through shrinking or extending the cluster, or by having it consumed by already placed containers.
* The way we place containers also impacts the availability, performance, and capacity of the distributed systems.
* All of this make scheduling containers both important and difficult(impossibe to do manually).

**Solution**
* We'll cover:
    * Main scheduling control mechanisms.
    * Driving forces that affect the placement.
    * Why to choose one or the other option and the resulting consequence.
* Similar to other Kubernetes components (API server, Kubelet), Scheduler can be run in isolation or not used at all.

* At a very high level, its main operation is to retrieve each newly created Pod definition from API server and assign it to a node.
* It finds a suitable node for every Pod (as long as there is such a node), whether that is for:
    * initial application placement
    * scaling up
    * moving an application from an unhealty node to a healthier one.
* It does so by considering runtime dependencies, resource requirements, and guiding policies for high availability by spreading Pods horizontally and also colocating Pods nearby for performance and low-latency interactions.

* For a scheduler to do its job correctly, it needs nodes with available capacity, and containers with declared resource profiles and guiding policies in place.
