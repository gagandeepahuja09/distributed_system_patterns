* Automated placement is the core function of the Kubernetes scheduler for assigning new Pods to nodes satisfying container resource requests and honoring *scheduling policies*.
* This patterns describes:
    * The principles of Kubernetes' scheduling algorithm.
    * The way to influence the placement decision from the outside.

**Problem**
* Containers have dependencies among themselves, dependencies to nodes, and resource demands, all of that changes over time too.
* The resources available on a cluster also vary over time, through shrinking or extending the cluster, or by having it consumed by already placed containers.
* The way we place containers also impacts the availability, performance, and capacity of the distributed systems.
* All of this make scheduling containers both important and difficult(impossibe to do manually).

**Solution**
* We'll cover:
    * Main scheduling control mechanisms.
    * Driving forces that affect the placement.
    * Why to choose one or the other option and the resulting consequence.
* Similar to other Kubernetes components (API server, Kubelet), Scheduler can be run in isolation or not used at all.

* At a very high level, its main operation is to retrieve each newly created Pod definition from API server and assign it to a node.
* It finds a suitable node for every Pod (as long as there is such a node), whether that is for:
    * initial application placement
    * scaling up
    * moving an application from an unhealty node to a healthier one.
* It does so by considering runtime dependencies, resource requirements, and guiding policies for high availability by spreading Pods horizontally and also colocating Pods nearby for performance and low-latency interactions.

* For a scheduler to do its job correctly, it needs nodes with available capacity, and containers with declared resource profiles and guiding policies in place.

**Available Node Resources**
* Kubernetes cluster needs to have nodes with enough resource capacity to run new Pods. Node capacity for a node only dedicated to Kubernetes:
`
    Allocatable [capacity for application pods] = 
        Node Capacity [available capacity on node]
        - Kube-Reserved [Kubernetes daemons like kubelet, container runtime]
        - System-Reserved [OS system daemons like udev, sshd]
`

**Container resource demands**
* Container should have their runtime dependencies and resource requirements defined.
* It boils down to having containers that declare their resource profiles (with request and limit) and environment dependencies such as storage or ports.
* Only then are Pods sensibly assigned to nodes and can run without affecting each other during peak times.

**Placement Policies**
* The scheduler has a default set of placement or predicate policies which are good enough for most cases and can be overridden during scheduler startup.
* Scheduler policies and custom schedulers can be defined only by an administrator as part of the cluster configuration.

* *Predicates* are rules that filter out unqualified nodes. Eg: *PodFitsHostPort* schedules Pods to request certain fixed host ports only on the nodes that have this port available.

* *Priorities* are rules that sort available nodes according to preferences. Eg. *LeastRequestedPriority* gives nodes with fewer requested resources a higher priority.

* In addition to configuring the policies of the default scheduler, it is also possible to run multiple schedulers and allow Pods to specify which scheduler to place them by specifying the field .spec.schedulerName.
